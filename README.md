# GroovyOneliner

This gem allows you to convert a groovy script file to a single line script. Currently it is being used in a production environment to
convert sane commented and formatted scripts to oneline scripts which will be injected in Elastic Search queries.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'groovy_oneliner'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install groovy_oneliner

## Usage

```
GroovyOneliner.compute(file: 'path/to/file')
```

If you want to cache reading the file (recommended for production & staging environments)

```
GroovyOneliner.compute(file: 'path/to/file', cache: true)
```
